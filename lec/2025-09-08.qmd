# Binary floating point

Binary floating point arithmetic is essentially scientific notation.
Where in decimal scientific notation we write
$$
  \frac{1}{3} = 3.333\ldots \times 10^{-1},
$$
in floating point, we write
$$
  \frac{(1)_2}{(11)_2} = (1.010101\ldots)_2 \times 2^{-2}.
$$
Because computers are finite, however, we can only keep a finite
number of bits after the binary point. We can also only keep a finite
number of bits for the exponent field. These facts turn out to have
interesting implications.

## Normalized representations

In general, a *normal floating point number* has the form
$$
  (-1)^s \times (1.b_1 b_2 \ldots b_p)_2 \times 2^{E},
$$
where $s \in \{0,1\}$ is the *sign bit*, $E$ is the *exponent*, and
$(1.b_2 \ldots b_p)_2$ is the *significand*. The normalized
representations are called normalized because they start with a one
before the binary point. Because this is always the case, we do not need
to store that digit explicitly; this gives us a "free" extra digit.

In the 64-bit double precision format, $p = 52$ bits are used to store
the significand, 11 bits are used for the exponent, and one bit is used
for the sign. The valid exponent range for normal double precision
floating point numbers is $-1023 < E < 1024$; the number $E$ is encoded
as an unsigned binary integer $E_{\mathrm{bits}}$ which is implicitly
shifted by 1023 ($E = E_{\mathrm{bits}}-1023$). This leaves two exponent
encodings left over for special purpose, one associated with
$E_{\mathrm{bits}} = 0$ (all bits zero), and one associated with all
bits set; we return to these in a moment.

In the 32-bit single-percision format, $p = 23$ bits are used to store
the significand, 8 bits are used for the exponent, and one bit is used
for the sign. The valid exponent range for normal is $-127 < E < 128$;
as in the double precision format, the representation is based on an
unsigned integer and an implicit shift, and two bit patterns are left
free for other uses.

We will call the distance between 1.0 and the next largest floating
point number one either an *ulp* (unit in the last place) or, more
frequently, machine epsilon (denoted $\macheps$). This is
$2^{-52} \approx 2 \times 10^{-16}$ for double precision and
$2^{-23} \approx 10^{-7}$ for single precision. This is the definition
used in most numerical analysis texts, and in MATLAB and Octave, but it
is worth noting that in a few places (e.g. in the C standard), call
machine epsilon the quantity that is half what we call machine epsilon.

## Subnormal representations

When the exponent field consists of all zero bits, we have a *subnormal*
representation. In general, a *subnormal floating point number* has the
form
$$
  (-1)^s \times (0.b_1 b_2 \ldots b_p)_2 \times
  2^{-E_{\mathrm{bias}}},
$$
where $E_{\mathrm{bias}}$ is 1023 for double precision and 127 for
single. Unlike the normal numbers, the subnormal numbers are evenly
spaced, and so the *relative* differences between successive subnormals
can be much larger than the relative differences between successive
normals.

Historically, there have been some floating point systems that lack
subnormal representations; and even today, some vendors encourage "flush
to zero" mode arithmetic in which all subnormal results are
automatically rounded to zero. But there are some distinct advantage to
these numbers. For example, the subnormals allow us to keep the
equivalence between $x-y = 0$ and $x = y$; without subnormals, this
identity can fail to hold in floating point. Apart from helping us
ensure standard identities, subnormals let us represent numbers close to
zero with reduced accuracy rather than going from full precision to zero
abruptly. This property is sometimes known as *gradual underflow*.

The most important of the subnormal numbers is zero. In fact, we
consider zero so important that we have two representations: $+0$ and
$-0$! These representations behave the same in most regards, but the
sign does play a subtle role; for example, $1/+0$ gives a representation
for $+\infty$, while $1/-0$ gives a representation for $-\infty$. The
default value of zero is $+0$; this is what is returned, for example, by
expressions such as $1.0-1.0$.

## Infinities and NaNs

A floating point representation in which the exponent bits are all set
to one and the signficand bits are all zero represents an *infinity*
(positive or negative).

When the exponent bits are all one and the significand bits are not all
zero, we have a *NaN* (Not a Number). A NaN is quiet or signaling
depending on the first bit of the significand; this distinguishes
between the NaNs that simply propagate through arithmetic and those that
cause exceptions when operated upon. The remaining significand bits can,
in principle, encode information about the details of how and where a
NaN was generated. In practice, these extra bits are typically ignored.
Unlike infinities (which can be thought of as a computer representation
of part of the extended reals[^1]), NaN "lives outside" the extended
real numbers.

Infinity and NaN values represent entities that are not part of the
standard real number system. They should not be interpreted
automatically as "error values," but they should be treated with
respect. When an infinity or NaN arises in a code in which nobody has
analyzed the code correctness in the presence of infinity or NaN values,
there is likely to be a problem. But when they are accounted for in the
design and analysis of a floating point routine, these representations
have significant value. For example, while an expression like $0/0$
cannot be interpreted without context (and therefore yields a NaN in
floating point), given context --- eg., a computation involving a
removable singularity --- we may be able to interpret a NaN, and
potentially replace it with some ordinary floating point value.

# Basic floating point arithmetic

For a general real number $x$, we will write
$$
  \fl(x) = \mbox{ correctly rounded floating point representation of } x.
$$
By default, "correctly rounded" means that we find the closest floating
point number to $x$, breaking any ties by rounding to the number with a
zero in the last bit[^2]. If $x$ exceeds the largest normal floating
point number, then $\fl(x) = \infty$; similarly, if $x$ is a negative
number with magnitude greater than the most negative normalized floating
point value, then $\fl(x) = -\infty$.

For basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division,
and square root), the floating point standard specifies that the
computer should produce the *true result, correctly rounded*. So the
Julia statement
```{.julia}
# Compute the sum of x and y (assuming they are exact)
z = x + y
```
actually computes the quantity $\hat{z} = \fl(x+y)$. If $\hat{z}$ is a
normal double-precision floating point number, it will agree with the
true $z$ to 52 bits after the binary point. That is, the relative error
will be smaller in magnitude than the *machine epsilon*
$\macheps = 2^{-53} \approx 1.1 \times 10^{-16}$:
$$
  \hat{z} = z(1+\delta), \quad |\delta| < \macheps.
$$
More generally, basic operations that produce normalized numbers are
correct to within a relative error of $\macheps$.

The floating point standard also *recommends* that common transcendental
functions, such as exponential and trig functions, should be correctly
rounded[^3], though compliant implementations that do not follow with
this recommendation may produce results with a relative error just
slightly larger than $\macheps$. Correct rounding of transcendentals is
useful in large part because it implies other properties: for example,
if a computer function to evaluate a monotone function returns a
correctly rounded result, then the computed function is also monotone.

Operations in which NaN appears as an input conventionally (but not
always) produce a NaN output. Comparisons in which NaN appears
conventionally produce false. But sometimes there is some subtlety in
accomplishing these semantics. For example, the following code for
finding the maximum element of a vector returns a NaN if one appears in
the first element, but otherwise results in the largest non-NaN element
of the array:
```{.julia}
# Find the maximum element of a vector -- naive about NaN
function mymax1(v)
  vmax = v[1];
  for k = 2:length(v)
    if v[k] > vmax
      vmax = v[k]
    end
  end
  vmax
end
```
In contrast, the following code always propagates a NaN to the output if
one appears in the input
```{.julia}
# Find the maximum element of a vector -- more careful about NaNs
function mymax2(v)
  vmax = v[1];
  for k = 2:length(v)
    if isnan(v[k]) | (v[k] > vmax)
      vmax = v[k]
    end
  end
  vmax
end
```
You are encouraged to play with different vectors involving some NaN or
all NaN values to see what the semantics for the built-in vector max are
in MATLAB, Octave, or your language of choice. You may be surprised by
the results!

Apart from NaN, floating point numbers do correspond to real numbers,
and comparisons between floating point numbers have the usual semantics
associated with comparisons between floating point numbers. The only
point that deserves some further comment is that plus zero and minus
zero are considered equal as floating point numbers, despite the fact
that they are not bitwise identical (and do not produce identical
results in all input expressions)[^4].

# Exceptions

We say there is an *exception* when the floating point result is not an
ordinary value that represents the exact result. The most common
exception is *inexact* (i.e. some rounding was needed). Other exceptions
occur when we fail to produce a normalized floating point number. These
exceptions are:

Underflow:

:   An expression is too small to be represented as a normalized
    floating point value. The default behavior is to return a subnormal.

Overflow:

:   An expression is too large to be represented as a floating point
    number. The default behavior is to return `inf`.

Invalid:

:   An expression evaluates to Not-a-Number (such as $0/0$)

Divide by zero:

:   An expression evaluates "exactly" to an infinite value (such as
    $1/0$ or $\log(0)$).

When exceptions other than inexact occur, the usual "$1 + \delta$" model
used for most rounding error analysis is not valid.

An important feature of the floating point standard is that an exception
should *not* stop the computation by default. This is part of why we
have representations for infinities and NaNs: the floating point system
is *closed* in the sense that every floating point operation will return
some result in the floating point system. Instead, by default, an
exception is *flagged* as having occurred[^5]. An actual exception (in
the sense of hardware or programming language exceptions) occurs only if
requested.

# Modeling floating point

The fact that normal floating point results have a relative error
bounded by $\macheps$ gives us a useful *model* for reasoning about
floating point error. We will refer to this as the "$1 + \delta$" model.
For example, suppose $x$ is an exactly-represented input to the Julia
statement
```{.julia}
z = 1-x*x
```
We can reason about the error in the computed $\hat{z}$ as follows:
$$\begin{aligned}
  t_1 &= \fl(x^2) = x^2 (1+\delta_1) \\
  t_2 &= 1-t_1 = (1-x^2)\left( 1 - \frac{\delta_1 x^2}{1-x^2} \right) \\
  \hat{z}
  &= \fl(1-t_1)
    = z \left( 1 - \frac{\delta_1 x^2}{1-x^2} \right)(1+\delta_2) \\
  & \approx z \left( 1 - \frac{\delta_1 x^2}{1-x^2} +\delta_2 \right),
\end{aligned}$$
where $|\delta_1|, |\delta_2| \leq \macheps$. As before, we throw away
the (tiny) term involving $\delta_1 \delta_2$. Note that if $z$ is
close to zero (i.e. if there is *cancellation* in the subtraction),
then the model shows the result may have a large relative error.

## First-order error analysis

Analysis in the $1+\delta$ model quickly gets to be a sprawling mess of
Greek letters unless one is careful. A standard trick to get around this
is to use *first-order* error analysis in which we linearize all
expressions involving roundoff errors. In particular, we frequently use
the approximations
$$\begin{aligned}
  (1+\delta_1)(1+\delta_2) & \approx 1+\delta_1 + \delta_2 \\
  1/(1+\delta) & \approx 1-\delta.
\end{aligned}$$
In general, we will resort to first-order analysis
without comment. Those students who think this is a sneaky trick to get
around our lack of facility with algebra[^6] may take comfort in the
fact that if $|\delta_i| < \macheps$, then in double precision
$$
\left| \prod_{i=1}^n (1+\delta_i) \prod_{i=n+1}^N (1+\delta_i)^{-1}
\right| < (1+1.03 N \macheps)
$$
for $N < 10^{14}$ (and a little further).

## Shortcomings of the model

The $1+\delta$ model has two shortcomings. First, it is only valid for
expressions that involve normalized numbers --- most notably, gradual
underflow breaks the model. Second, the model is sometimes pessimistic.
Certain operations, such as taking a difference between two numbers
within a factor of $2$ of each other, multiplying or dividing by a
factor of two[^7], or multiplying two single-precision numbers into a
double-precision result, are *exact* in floating point. There are useful
operations such as simulating extended precision using ordinary floating
point that rely on these more detailed properties of the floating point
system, and cannot be analyzed using just the $1+\delta$ model.

# Finding and fixing floating point problems

Floating point arithmetic is not the same as real arithmetic. Even
simple properties like associativity or distributivity of addition and
multiplication only hold approximately. Thus, some computations that
look fine in exact arithmetic can produce bad answers in floating point.
What follows is a (very incomplete) list of some of the ways in which
programmers can go awry with careless floating point programming.

## Cancellation

If $\hat{x} = x(1+\delta_1)$ and $\hat{y} = y(1+\delta_2)$ are floating
point approximations to $x$ and $y$ that are very close, then
$\fl(\hat{x}-\hat{y})$ may be a poor approximation to $x-y$ due to
*cancellation*. In some ways, the subtraction is blameless in this tail:
if $x$ and $y$ are close, then $\fl(\hat{x}-\hat{y}) =
\hat{x}-\hat{y}$, and the subtraction causes no additional rounding
error. Rather, the problem is with the approximation error already
present in $\hat{x}$ and $\hat{y}$.

The standard example of loss of accuracy revealed through cancellation
is in the computation of the smaller root of a quadratic using the
quadratic formula, e.g. 
$$
  x = 1-\sqrt{1-z}
$$
for $z$ small. Fortunately, some algebraic manipulation gives an
equivalent formula that does not suffer cancellation:
$$
  x =
    \left( 1-\sqrt{1-z} \right)
    \left(\frac{1+\sqrt{1-z}}{1+\sqrt{1-z}}\right)
  =
    \frac{z}{1+\sqrt{1-z}}.
$$

## Sensitive subproblems

We often solve problems by breaking them into simpler subproblems.
Unfortunately, it is easy to produce badly-conditioned subproblems as
steps to solving a well-conditioned problem. As a simple (if contrived)
example, try running the following Julia code:
```{.julia}
function silly_sqrt(n=100)
  x = 2.0
  for k = 1:n
    x = sqrt(x)
  end
  for k = 1:n
    x = x^2
  end
  x
end
```
In exact arithmetic, this should produce 2, but what does it produce in
floating point? In fact, the first loop produces a correctly rounded
result, but the second loop represents the function $x^{2^{60}}$, which
has a condition number far greater than $10^{16}$ --- and so all
accuracy is lost.

## Unstable recurrences

One of my favorite examples of this problem is the recurrence relation
for computing the integrals
$$
  E_n = \int_{0}^1 x^n e^{x-1} \, dx.
$$
Integration by parts yields the recurrence
$$\begin{aligned}
  E_0 &= 1-1/e \\
  E_n &= 1-nE_{n-1}, \quad n \geq 1.
\end{aligned}$$
This looks benign enough at first glance: no single step of this
recurrence causes the error to explode. But each step amplifies the
error somewhat, resulting in an exponential growth in error[^8].

## Undetected underflow

In Bayesian statistics, one sometimes computes ratios of long products.
These products may underflow individually, even when the final ratio is
not far from one. In the best case, the products will grow so tiny that
they underflow to zero, and the user may notice an infinity or NaN in
the final result. In the worst case, the underflowed results will
produce nonzero subnormal numbers with unexpectedly poor relative
accuracy, and the final result will be wildly inaccurate with no warning
except for the (often ignored) underflow flag.

## Bad branches

A NaN result is often a blessing in disguise: if you see an unexpected
NaN, at least you *know* something has gone wrong! But all comparisons
involving NaN are false, and so when a floating point result is used to
compute a branch condition and an unexpected NaN appears, the result can
wreak havoc. As an example, try out the following code in Julia with
'0.0/0.0' as input.
```{.julia}
function test_negative(x)
  if x < 0.0
    "$(x) is negative"
  elseif x >= 0.0
    "$(x) is non-negative"
  else
    "$(x) is ... uh..."
  end
end
```

# Problems to ponder

1.  How do we accurately evaluate $\sqrt{1+x}-\sqrt{1-x}$ when
    $x \ll 1$?

2.  How do we accurately evaluate $\ln \sqrt{x+1}-\ln\sqrt{x}$ when
    $x \gg 1$?

3.  How do we accurately evaluate $(1-\cos(x))/\sin(x)$ when $x \ll 1$?

4.  How would we compute $\cos(x)-1$ accurately when $x \ll 1$?

5.  The *Lamb-Oseen vortex* is a solution to the 2D Navier-Stokes
    equation that plays a key role in some methods for computational
    fluid dynamics. It has the form
    $$v_{\theta}(r,t) = \frac{\Gamma}{2 \pi r}
          \left( 1 - \exp\left( \frac{-r^2}{4 \nu t} \right) \right)$$
    How would one evaluate $v(r,t)$ to high relative accuracy for all
    values of $r$ and $t$ (barring overflow or underflow)?

6.  For $x > 1$, the equation $x = \cosh(y)$ can be solved as
    $$y = -\ln\left(x - \sqrt{x^2-1}\right).$$
    What happens when $x = 10^8$? Can we fix it?

7.  The difference equation 
    $$x_{k+1} = 2.25x_k - 0.5 x_{k-1}$$
    with starting values 
    $$x_1 = \frac{1}{3}, \qquad x_2 = \frac{1}{12}$$
    has solution
    $$x_k = \frac{4^{1-k}}{3}.$$
    Is this what you actually see if you compute? What goes wrong?

8.  Considering the following two Julia fragments:
    ```{.julia}
    # Version 1
    f = (exp(x)-1)/x

    # Version 2
    y = exp(x)
    f = (1-y)/log(y)
    ```
    In exact arithmetic, the two fragments are equivalent. In floating
    point, the first formulation is inaccurate for $x \ll 1$, while the
    second formulation remains accurate. Why?

9.  Running the recurrence $E_n = 1-nE_{n-1}$ *forward* is an unstable
    way to compute $\int_0^1 x^n e^{x-1} \, dx$. However, we can get
    good results by running the recurrence *backward* from the estimate
    $E_n \approx 1/(N+1)$ starting at large enough $N$. Explain why. How
    large must $N$ be to compute $E_{20}$ to near machine precision?

10. How might you accurately compute this function for $|x| < 1$?
    $$f(x) = \sum_{j=0}^\infty \left( \cos(x^j)-1 \right)$$

[^1]: The extended reals in this case means $\bbR$ together with
    $\pm \infty$. This is sometimes called the *two-point
    compactification* of $\bbR$. In some areas of analysis (e.g. complex
    variables), the *one-point compactification* involving a single,
    unsigned infinity is also useful. This was explicitly supported in
    early proposals for the IEEE floating point standard, but did not
    make it in. The fact that we have signed infinities in floating
    point is one reason why it makes sense to have signed zeros ---
    otherwise, for example, we would have $1/(1/-\infty)$ yield
    $+\infty$.

[^2]: There are other rounding modes beside the default, but we will not
    discuss them in this class

[^3]: For algebraic functions, it is possible to determine in advance
    how many additional bits of precision are needed to correctly round
    the result for a function of one input. In contrast, transcendental
    functions can produce outputs that fall arbitrarily close to the
    halfway point between two floating point numbers.

[^4]: This property of signed zeros is just a little bit horrible. But
    to misquote Winston Churchill, it is the worst definition of
    equality except all the others that have been tried.

[^5]: There is literally a register inside the computer with a set of
    flags to denote whether an exception has occurred in a given chunk
    of code. This register is highly problematic, as it represents a
    single, centralized piece of global state. The treatment of the
    exception flags --- and of exceptions generally --- played a
    significant role in the debates leading up to the last revision of
    the IEEE 754 floating point standard, and I would be surprised if
    they are not playing a role again in the current revision of the
    standard.

[^6]: Which it is.

[^7]: Assuming that the result does not overflow or produce a subnormal.

[^8]: Part of the reason that I like this example is that one can run
    the recurrence *backward* to get very good results, based on the
    estimate $E_n \approx 1/(n+1)$ for $n$ large.
